					<p>The Building Efficiency Targeting Tool for Energy Retrofits (BETTER) is a free, award-winning web application available at <a class="color-3" target="_blank" href="https://better.lbl.gov/">https://better.lbl.gov/</a> that provides users with visibility into the energy performance of buildings and portfolios (without expensive audits and complex modeling) to help identify immediate, cost-saving energy efficiency measures (EEM) (technological and operational) and to focus further assessments and studies. The tool analyzes a building’s energy use in response to weather conditions to generate potential energy, cost, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions and customized efficiency recommendations at the building and portfolio levels. BETTER’s fully-automated approach also allows users to compare a building’s performance against either a built-in reference dataset or their own building portfolio, enabling large portfolio operators to target efficiency measures in buildings with the highest savings potential first. The source code of BETTER’s modular, cross-platform analytical engine is available on GitHub (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.github.com/LBNL-JCI-ICF/better" class="color-3">www.github.com/LBNL-JCI-ICF/better</a>) and can be adopted, redeveloped, and redistributed freely under an open-source license, allowing users to incorporate BETTER’s analytical capabilities into their own software platforms and tools.</p>
