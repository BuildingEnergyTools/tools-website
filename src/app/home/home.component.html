      <p>The U.S. Department of Energy developed a comprehensive suite of tools for accessing, managing, analyzing and sharing building energy data. This website describes how they can be used to support <a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/benchmarking-and-building-performance-standards-policy-toolkit">building performance standards (BPS) policies</a>, one of many possible use cases.</p>

      <!--<div [fxFlex]="45" class="left-side" fxLayout="column">
        <p>More local governments are choosing to implement Building Performance Standard (BPS) policies to meet their energy efficiency and climate-related goals. BPS policies go beyond benchmarking, requiring owners of buildings covered by the policy to conduct an energy audit and install recommended upgrades in pursuit of a minimum performance standard.</p>

        <p>These mandates often lack funding for implementation, leaving public officials to do their best without additional staff or resources. This can result in a heavy reliance on manual data handling processes â€“ processes which are time consuming and prone to error.</p>
      </div>
      <div [fxFlex]="50" fxLayout="column">
        <p>To reduce the burden of BPS implementation, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its National Laboratory partners created a suite of powerful, interoperable, free and open-source data tools. These tools snap directly into existing workflows and make it easy to collect, manage, analyze, and share the building-related data needed for a BPS policy.</p>

        <p>Sustainability leaders like Washington, D.C. and others are already using these tools to meet their goals. And since they're backed by DOE, you can count on long-term maintenance and support.</p>
