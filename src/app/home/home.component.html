  <p>More cities are passing building energy performance standards (BPS) to improve the efficiency of their jurisdiction's buildings. BPS policies go beyond benchmarking, requiring building owners to get an energy audit and install recommended upgrades in pursuit of a defined goal.</p>
  <p>These mandates often lack funding for implementation, leaving city staff to do the best they can without any additional staff or tools. Often, this means a lot of manual data handling with time-consuming, error-prone processes (Hi, Excel).</p>

  <p>To help cities deploy a BPS program, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its national laboratory partners created a suite of powerful, free, and open-source data tools. These tools can snap directly into existing workflows and make it easy to collect, manage, analyze, and share building-related data.</p>
  <p>Sustainability leaders like Washington, D.C. and using these tools to meet their goals. And since they're backed by DOE, you can count on long-term maintenance and support.</p>
