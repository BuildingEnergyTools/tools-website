    <p>The Building Energy Asset Score (Asset Score) is a free, web-based tool for assessing the physical and structural energy efficiency of commercial and multifamily residential buildings. </p>
    <p>Asset Score assesses the energy efficiency of building assets (including envelope, mechanical, electrical and service hot water systems) and generates an Energy Asset Score Report which includes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An overall efficiency score ranging from 1-10</li>
        <li>An energy efficiency assessment of the building’s individual systems</li>
        <li>Total estimated building energy usage under standard operation and by end use</li>
        <li>Opportunities to improve building efficiency, and a “potential” energy efficiency score based on identified upgrades</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Because Asset Score reflects the energy efficiency of a building based solely on its design, construction, and energy systems, users can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quickly compare the physical energy efficiency of their building with other buildings</li>
        <li>Communicate building efficiency to the marketplace</li>
        <li>Identify opportunities to invest in energy efficiency upgrades</li>
      </ul>

    <p>To get started, <a href="https://buildingenergyscore.energy.gov/d/users/sign_up" target="_blank" class="color-3">register for an Asset Score account</a>. View the Introduction to Asset Score webinar on this page and review the additional resources on this page as well as the <a href="https://help.buildingenergyscore.com/support/home" class="color-3" target="_blank">Asset Score User Guide</a>. </p>

      <p>An ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager score enables the comparison of buildings based on their energy consumption, as indicated by actual energy bills (how a building <strong>actually</strong> performs based on use). The Portfolio Manager score may reflect how efficiently a building is operated and maintained.</p>
      <p>Asset Score reflects the energy efficiency of a building based solely on its design, construction, and energy systems (how a building <strong>should</strong> perform based on construction). Think of it as a “miles per gallon” sticker for buildings.</p>

  <p>Using Asset Score and Portfolio Manager together provides powerful information that can identify energy upgrades and improvements in building operations. For example, in the graphic above: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A building that receives a low ENERGY STAR score and a high Asset Score may benefit from a re-tuning or retrocommissioning.</li>
      <li>A building that receives a high ENERGY STAR score and a low Asset Score may benefit from some capital improvements. </li>
    </ul>
