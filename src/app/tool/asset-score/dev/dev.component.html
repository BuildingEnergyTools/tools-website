<h2 class="mat-h2 mb-4">Links for Developers</h2>
<p>We welcome use of the Asset Score by energy services companies, consultants, software providers and other parties that offer services to building owners to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. Such providers can integrate their tools seamlessly with the Asset Score through an application programming interface (API).</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 mt-4">RESTful Web Service</h3>
<p>The Asset Score API is a RESTful style web service. For more information about REST, please visit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer</a></p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 mt-4">API Organization Token</h3>

<p>In order to create an account to authenticate and utilize the API, users must first get an API Organization Token. The token must be passed along with the parameters used when creating a new account. Please send an email with the subject line "Request API Token" to: <a href="mailto:asset.score@ee.doe.gov?subject=Request API Token">asset.score@ee.doe.gov</a></p>

<p>Once the organization token is received the API can be utilized to create a user account. A user account is used to obtain an API Access Token, described below. Follow the API documentation for details of the parameters needed: <a href="https://buildingenergyscore.energy.gov/apidoc/v2/users/create.html">POST /api/v2/users</a></p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 mt-4">API Access Token</h3>

<p>Once a user account has been created the user can authenticate against the API to generate a user-specific access token. All subsequent interactions with the API must include the authenticated user's API token. Follow the API documentation for details of authentication method: <a href="https://buildingenergyscore.energy.gov/apidoc/v2/users/authenticate.html">POST /api/v2/users/authenticate</a></p>

<p>The API Access Token is specific to an individual user, and is distinct from the API Organization Token. The API Organization Token is used only to create user accounts and to authenticate those accounts in order to receive the API Access Token.</p>

<p>To use your API access token, simply pass the key as a URL parameter when making requests. For example:</p>

<p class="pl-3"><code>GET https://api.labworks.org/api/v2/preview_buildings?token=YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN</code></p>
