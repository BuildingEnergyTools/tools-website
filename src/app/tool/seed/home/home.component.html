    <p>The Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED) Platform is a central database for building-related data. It merges information from ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, Audit Template, and other sources in one place, behind one intuitive interface. With just a few clicks, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Merge datasets</li>
        <li>Assess the completeness of audit reports</li>
        <li>Perform automated quality assurance</li>
        <li>Share data with third parties</li>
        <li>Track the progress of BEPS program compliance</li>
        <li>Leverage analysis & evaluation tools to identify upgrade opportunities within buildings and across the city’s building stock, assess BEPS program performance, and set program cycle goals</li>
        <li>Share data with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and dashboards.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Because SEED automates so many manual, time-intensive processes, even organizations with severely limited resources and staff can use it to achieve their program goals. </p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 mb-4">Sample Data</h3>
<p>The SEED Sample Data collection includes two files and can be downloaded from the table below:</p>

<ul><li><strong>covered-buildings-sample.csv</strong>—sample tax assessor data with 512 building records</li>
  <li><strong>portfolio-manager-sample.csv</strong>—sample Energy Star Portfolio Manager data with 512 records which match the data in covered-buildings-sample.csv based on the Address field</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this represents an ideal case, but it can be used to confirm proper program performance.</p>

<p>All sample data should work with all versions of SEED, although the newer datasets may contain fields that do not exist in earlier versions.</p>
