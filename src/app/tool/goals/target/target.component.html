    <p>Use ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to collect energy use data for buildings of interest. Portfolio Manager’s auto-generated Excel reports can be uploaded directly into BETTER. Within BETTER, you can assess your buildings’ performance to target efficiency measures in those buildings with the highest savings potential first. (In the near future, BETTER will be able to communicate directly with Asset Score, Audit Template, and the SEED Platform via BuildingSync; this capability is under development.) </p>
