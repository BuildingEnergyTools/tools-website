<h2 class="mat-h2 mb-4">Resources</h2>
<p>The following documents are available to help you understand and use BuildingSync:</p>

<p>Each release of the schema includes several <a href="https://buildingsync.net/releases">supporting documents, the Schema, a Data Dictionary, and a List of Measures</a>. More information regarding each of the supporting documents is described below.

<h3 class="mat-h3">Schema</h3>
<p>The BuildingSync schema can be used to create and validate XML files. <a href="https://buildingsync.net/schema">Various schema versions</a> have been released.</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3">Data Dictionary</h3>
<p>The data field "dictionary" includes field names, definitions, units, and other attributes for the enumerated fields. The data dictionary is aligned with BEDES, but includes only the subset of data fields that are relevant for energy audits. This page can be referenced to help standardize the terminology used in energy audits, but it does not provide a structure that allows data to be exchanged across different applications.</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3">List of Measures</h3>
<p>The list of measures defined in the BuildingSync Schema contain a TechnologyCategory and a list of valid enumerations.</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3">Other Supporting Documents</h3>
<p>There are several supporting documents that are independent of the version of the schema. The supporting documents include Example Files, a Geometry Reference Sheet, and an Implementation Guide. More information can be found below.</p>

<h4 class="mat-h4">Building Procurement</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://buildingsync.net/static/documents/BuildingSync-RFP-RFQ-language.pdf">Specifying BuildingSync Templates for RFPs and RFQs</a> document aids in standardizing the Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Qualifications (RFQ) language for BuildingSync and BuildingSync-adjacent projects. The document provides templates that can copied into an RFP or RFQ.</p>

<h4 class="mat-h4">Example Files</h4>
<p>These <a href="https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/tree/develop-v2/examples">example files</a> aid in applying the schema to a particular energy auditing software. This collection is not exhaustive, but should still be helpful.</p>

<h4 class="mat-h4">Onboarding Guide</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://buildingsync.net/static/documents/BuildingSync-on-boarding.pdf">Onboarding Guide</a> is a document illustrating the process to adopt an instance of the BuildingSync schema. The Guide provides context for BuildingSync use cases and how they are used to downselect the important fields in BuildingSync for a specific use case.</p>

<h4 class="mat-h4">Geometry Reference Sheet</h4>
<p>The BuildingSync <a href="https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/releases/download/v2.4.0/geometry_reference.pdf">Geometry Reference Sheet</a> illustrates how most of the simplified geometric terms (shapes, side names, vertices, orientations) are defined in the context of BuildingSync.</p>
