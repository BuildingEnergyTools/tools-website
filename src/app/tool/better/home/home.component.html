<p>The Building Efficiency Targeting Tool for Energy Retrofits (BETTER) identifies cost-saving energy and emissions reductions in buildings and portfolios, without site visits or complex modeling. Use it to identify immediate cost-saving operational and technological improvements and target buildings and systems for more in-depth audits and analysis.</p>

    <p>"The ability of the tool to go beyond benchmarking by offering energy efficiency measure recommendations is extremely valuable, particularly at times when on-site assessments are either impractical or not feasible."</p>

    <p class="bold">With BETTER, you can easily:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantify actual operational energy, cost, and emissions reduction potential at the building and portfolio levels.</li>
      <li>Identify efficiency measures (technical and behavioral) to immediately improve operational energy performance at the building and portfolio levels.</li>
      <li>Compare and rank buildings across a portfolio according to annual electricity and fossil energy use intensity (EUI) and annual cost savings potential.</li>
      <li>Target buildings with high cost-savings potential for audits or further analysis.</li>
      <li>Identify buildings with high fossil EUI for electrification and decarbonization.</li>
      <li>Assess the breakdown of annual utility costs and potential savings by load type (e.g., cooling, baseload, and heating) at the building level.</li>
      <li>Investigate electricity and fossil fuel change-point models.</li>
      <li>See how model coefficients benchmark against peers and which systems and equipment in a building may be underperforming.</li>
      <li>Export data to the <a routerLink="/seed" class="color-3">SEED Platform</a> database or other audit tools.</li>
      <li>Share data with other people and systems in CSV, PDF, or <a routerLink="/building-sync" class="color-3">BuildingSync XML</a> formats.</li>
      <li>Incorporate BETTER's analytical capabilities into your own software platforms and tools.</li>
      <li>Leverage expert support from DOE and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</li>
    </ul>
