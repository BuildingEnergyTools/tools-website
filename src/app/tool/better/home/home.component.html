    <p>The Building Efficiency Targeting Tool for Energy Retrofits (BETTER) is a free, award-winning web application available at <a href="https://better.lbl.gov/" target="_blank" class="color-3">https://better.lbl.gov/</a> that uses readily available building and monthly energy data to provide visibility into the operating energy performance of buildings and portfolios without site visits and complex modeling. The tool identifies immediate, cost-saving energy efficiency operational and technological measures and prioritizes further audits and studies.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">How It Works</h3>
<p>BETTER utilizes a novel, open-source <a href="https://github.com/LBNL-JCI-ICF/better" target="_blank" class="color-3">analytical engine</a> and user-friendly web interface to automatically analyze building and portfolio energy use in response to different weather conditions. With minimal data inputs, the tool benchmarks a building’s electric and fossil energy use against peers; quantifies energy, cost and greenhouse (GHG) reduction potentials at the building and portfolio levels; and recommends action-oriented energy efficiency measures to decarbonize and electrify buildings or portfolios, targeting specific savings levels.

      <p>“The ability of the tool to go beyond benchmarking by offering energy efficiency measure recommendations is extremely valuable, particularly at times when on-site assessments are either impractical or not feasible.”</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">Data Requirements</h3>
<p>BETTER requires minimal data inputs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building ID or name</li>
  <li>Location (U.S. zip code or city, state)</li>
  <li>Gross floor area (excluding parking)</li>
  <li>Primary building space type (i.e.,  50% of the gross floor area)</li>
  <li>12 consecutive months of energy use and cost for all fuels used by the building</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">Interoperability</h3>
<p>BETTER can input data from ENERGY STAR® PortfolioManager® and a BuildingSync® file read/write capability is being added to facilitate data transfer between BETTER and Asset Score, Audit Template, and the Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED)TM Platform. SEED users will also have the option to access BETTER’s analytical reports for buildings from within the SEED Platform.</p>
