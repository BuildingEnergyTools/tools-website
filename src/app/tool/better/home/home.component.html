    <p>The Building Efficiency Targeting Tool for Energy Retrofits (BETTER) is a free, award-winning web application available at <a class="color-3" target="_blank" href="https://better.lbl.gov/">https://better.lbl.gov/</a> that provides users with visibility into the energy performance of buildings and portfolios (without expensive audits and complex modeling) to help identify immediate, cost-saving energy efficiency measures (EEM) (technological and operational) and to focus further assessments and studies. The tool analyzes a building’s energy use in response to weather conditions to generate potential energy, cost, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions and customized efficiency recommendations at the building and portfolio levels. BETTER’s fully-automated approach also allows users to compare a building’s performance against either a built-in reference dataset or their own building portfolio, enabling large portfolio operators to target efficiency measures in buildings with the highest savings potential first. The source code of BETTER’s modular, cross-platform analytical engine is available on GitHub (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.github.com/LBNL-JCI-ICF/better" class="color-3">www.github.com/LBNL-JCI-ICF/better</a>) and can be adopted, redeveloped, and redistributed freely under an open-source license, allowing users to incorporate BETTER’s analytical capabilities into their own software platforms and tools.</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started using BETTER, visit the <a href="https://better.lbl.gov/how_it_works/" class="color-3" target="_blank">How It Works page</a> and access a video with stepwise instructions for using BETTER, or take a look at the “Introduction to BETTER and Training for New Users” presentation. You can also visit the News Page to learn about upcoming trainings or reach out to Carolyn Szum at <a href="mailto:ccszum@lbl.gov" class="color-3">ccszum@lbl.gov</a>.</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">Methodology</h3>
<p>BETTER leverages the American Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Inverse Modeling Toolkit to develop inverse (or change-point) models of building energy performance from monthly energy data and uses them to analyze historical trends and benchmark the performance of similar buildings. BETTER provides a preliminary estimate of the size and make-up of potential energy efficiency projects. </p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">Data Requirements</h3>
<p>BETTER requires the following data inputs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A building name and identification number</li>
  <li>Building location (U.S. zip code or city, state)</li>
  <li>Building gross floor area (excluding parking)</li>
  <li>Primary building space type (i.e., the space type that accounts for more than 50% of the building gross floor area)</li>
  <li>12 to 36 consecutive months of energy consumption for all fuels used in the building, including billing start and end dates, energy type, energy unit, energy consumption value</li>
  <li>Monthly data energy cost is optional, as proxy fuel price information is provided by better</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">Data Input Methods</h3>
<p>BETTER offers multiple ways to input data for analyses, including: (1) BETTER Excel data upload template; (2) an auto-generated ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® Excel report; or (3) the BETTER application programming interface (API) (<a href="https://better.lbl.gov/api/" class="color-3" target="_blank">https://better.lbl.gov/api/</a>). The U.S. Department of ENERGY (DOE) is also in the process of adding a BuildingSync® file read/write capability to BETTER to facilitate data transfer between BETTER and Asset Score, Audit Template, and the Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED) Platform. SEED users will also have the option to access BETTER’s analytical reports for buildings directly from the SEED Platform. </p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">About the Developers</h3>
<p>BETTER is made possible by support from the U.S. DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Building Technologies Office (BTO). It is being developed under Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) No. FP00007388 between the Regents of the University of California Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, under its U.S. DOE Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231, and Johnson Controls, with assistance from ICF. BETTER is currently in a beta version, and will be updated over time. </p>
