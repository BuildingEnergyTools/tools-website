<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">How It Works</h3>
<p>BETTER utilizes an open-source, data-driven <a href="https://github.com/LBNL-JCI-ICF/better" target="_blank" class="color-3">analytical engine</a> and user-friendly web interface to automatically analyze a building's monthly energy usage in response to weather conditions. With minimal data inputs, the tool benchmarks a building's electric and fossil energy usage against peers; quantifies energy, cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potentials at the building and portfolio levels; and recommends energy efficiency measures to decarbonize and electrify buildings and portfolios.</p>

      <p>“The ability of the tool to go beyond benchmarking by offering energy efficiency measure recommendations is extremely valuable, particularly at times when on-site assessments are either impractical or not feasible.”</p>

<h3 class="mat-h3 color-3">Interoperability</h3>
<p>BETTER can be used in combination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY STAR® PortfolioManager® and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Energy Asset Score to conduct multilayered analysis on buildings to deliver <strong>both</strong> superior structural performance and operational energy performance. Currently, BETTER can input data from ENERGY STAR® PortfolioManager®, and a BuildingSync® file read/write capability is being added to facilitate data and analytics transfer between BETTER and Asset Score, Audit Template, and the Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED)TM Platform.</p>
