<h2 class="mat-h2">How It Works</h2>
<p>BETTER utilizes an open-source, data-driven <a href="https://github.com/LBNL-JCI-ICF/better">analytical engine</a> and user-friendly web interface to automatically analyze a building's monthly energy usage in response to weather conditions. With minimal data inputs, the tool benchmarks a building's electric and fossil energy usage against peers; quantifies energy, cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potentials at the building and portfolio levels; and recommends energy efficiency measures to decarbonize and electrify buildings and portfolios.</p>

<h2 class="mat-h2">Who is Using BETTER?</h2>
<p>BETTER is used by federal, state, and municipal government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) – Goddard Space Flight Center and the Department of Energy and Environment in the District of Columbia; school districts; energy service companies, including Johnson Controls; multinational corporations; investors and lenders, like Citi; and non-profit organizations, such as PowerOptions and World Resources Institute (WRI).

<h2 class="mat-h2">Interoperability</h2>
<p>BETTER can be used in combination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY STAR® PortfolioManager® and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Energy Asset Score to conduct multilayered analysis on buildings to deliver <strong>both</strong> superior structural performance and operational energy performance. Currently, BETTER can input data from ENERGY STAR® PortfolioManager® or a BuildingSync® file to facilitate data and analytics transfer between BETTER and Asset Score, Audit Template, and the Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED)TM Platform. Users of SEED can also run BETTER and view BETTER reports from within the SEED platform.
