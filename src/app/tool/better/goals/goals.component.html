<h2 class="mat-h2 mb-4">Goals & Outcomes</h2>
<p>Quantify savings potential, identify measures, and suggest areas for deeper evaluations.</p>

<p>BETTER provides analyses at the individual building and portfolio levels. BETTER’s Individual Building Report shows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Annual building energy use and cost savings potential</li>
    <li>Annual building GHG emissions reduction potential </li>
    <li>Detailed energy efficiency recommendations for the building</li>
    <li>Annual utility cost and savings breakdowns by end use (i.e., heating, cooling, baseload)</li> 
    <li>Monthly electric and fossil energy use trends (baseline and projections with assumed efficiency improvements)</li>
    <li>Electricity and fossil fuel change-point models and model coefficient benchmarking</li>
  </ul>

<p>BETTER’s Portfolio Summary Report shows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Annual portfolio energy use and cost savings potential</li>
    <li>Annual portfolio GHG emissions reduction potential</li>
    <li>Top five energy efficiency recommendations for the portfolio</li>
    <li>Electric and fossil energy use intensity (EUI) and cost savings comparisons by building</li>
    <li>Interactive charts and tables to sort, rank, and prioritize buildings for tune-ups, audits, etc.</li>
  </ul>
