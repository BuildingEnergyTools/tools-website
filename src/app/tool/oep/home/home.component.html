<p>The DOE-funded OpenEfficiency Platform (OEP) lets efficiency programs connect Portfolio Manager and SEED to Salesforce, automating many reporting processes. It features a Salesforce managed package, a MuleSoft API, implementation case studies, Salesforce email templates and more. Unlike custom solutions, the OEP can be quickly adopted without extensive training or prior experience.</p>

<!-- <p>OpenEfficiency Platform (OEP) is a U.S. Department of Energy-funded initiative to help commercial whole building energy efficiency programs be more efficient and gain more value from data. It involved pilots that focused on exploring use cases for existing Federal tools and industry standards and their integration to support programs. The graphic below shows how OpenEfficiency Platform tools integrate with each other and with other building energy data tools, such as SEED, Asset Score, and ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager:</p>

<p>The OEP GitHub repository houses open source resources developed as part of this initiative; It includes folders for documentation of a full Benchmark use case, the OEI Salesforce Manged Package, and sample code for connecting to Energy Design Assistance Program Tracker (EDAPT), ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (ESPM), and Green Button Connect (GBC) OAuth 2.0:</p>
