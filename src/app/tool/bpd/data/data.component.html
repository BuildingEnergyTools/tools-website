<h2 class="mat-h2 mb-4">About the Data</h2>

<p>The Building Performance Database is currently the largest publically available source of building energy performance data. It contains information about the building’s location, use, and physical and operational characteristics. All of the data in the BPD is real – there is no modeled or default data.</p>

<p>The value of the BPD lies in its ability to analyze custom-defined peer groups. BPD users create control variables for peer groups, such as building type, location, or detailed building characteristics, and can then analyze the statistical relationship between variables within a peer group or compare peer groups to each other.</p>

<p>The BPD depends upon the amount and quality of data it contains. Basic building information and monthly energy consumption data can be used to compare similar buildings and identify high and low performers. Richer data, such as equipment information and interval meter data, will enable statistical analysis of potential retrofit measures and other advanced analysis. As more data is contributed, more advanced analyses will become possible. New data is being added regularly, and there is no limit to the amount of data that the BPD can hold.</p>

<p>Unlike the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), the BPD is not intended to be a statistically representative sample of the building stock. The BPD can be used to analyze trends within custom defined local peer groups – in many cases there are sizeable peer groups for specific real estate sub-markets, which is not the case with subsets of CBECS and RECS. Nevertheless, as the number of buildings in the database increases, it is anticipated that the distribution will eventually approach the distribution of the underlying building stock. Statistical methods to test this hypothesis are under development.</p>
