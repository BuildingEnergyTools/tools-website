<h2 class="mat-h2 mb-4">About the Data</h2>

<p>The BPD contains information for over 1 million commercial and residential buildings. Fields include location (city, state, ZIP, climate zone), floor area and primary use type, operational characteristics (operating hours and number of occupants), systems level data (lighting, heating, and cooling types), certifications (ENERGY STAR, LEED, etc.), and more. For the full list of fields, refer to the <a href="https://bpd-api-docs.lbl.gov" target="_blank" class="color-3">API documentation <span class="ml-1 align-center"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a>. Data availability depends on location and building type, but in general, most buildings have location, type, and energy use data, while few buildings have operational, systems, or certifications data.</p>

<p>All data in the BPD are converted into a <a routerLink="../../bedes" class="color-3">standard format</a> and <a href="https://buildings.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/data-preparation-process-for-the-bpd.pdf" target="_blank" class="color-3">quality checked <span class="ml-1 align-center"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a> by LBNL before being added to the database.</p>

<p>Unlike the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), the BPD is not intended to be a statistically representative sample of the building stock. However, it is approximately <a href="https://buildings.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/is-the-bpd-nationally-representative.pdf" target="_blank" class="color-3">representative for some peer groups <span class="ml-1 align-center"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a>. As we gather more data, we expect the BPD to more closely represent the actual building stock.</p>

<p>The utility of the BPD depends on the quality and quantity of data it contains, and all data are submitted voluntarily by contributors. If you would like to help improve the BPD by contributing your data, please contact BTODataTools@ee.doe.gov. All data are kept anonymous and secure.</p>
