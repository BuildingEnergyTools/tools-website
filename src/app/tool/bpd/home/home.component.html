<p>Would you like to see how a building stacks up against real-world peers? The Building Performance Database (BPD) features measured performance data for over 1 million U.S. buildings — the largest public collection of such information available.</p>
<div class="callout">
  <div class="btn-type-3 p-3 ">
    <p>"The BPD is a valuable source of information with powerful filters. Being able to filter by climate zone, building type, building construction year, and building square footage gives us key benchmarking data, even before we visit a facility."</p>

    <p>The Building Performance Database (BPD) is the nation's largest dataset of information about the energy-related characteristics of commercial and residential buildings. The BPD combines, cleanses and anonymizes data collected by federal, state and local governments, utilities, energy efficiency programs, building owners and private companies, and makes it available to the public. The website allows users to explore the data across real estate sectors and regions, and compare various physical and operational characteristics to gain a better understanding of market conditions and trends in energy performance. 
    </p>
    <p>Product and service providers can also incorporate the results of BPD queries into their own products and services, via use of the application programming interface (API). </p>

  <p>The BPD statistically analyzes the energy performance of physical and operational characteristics of real commercial and residential buildings, via two primary methods: <em>“Explore,”</em> which allows users to browse a single dataset within the BPD, and <em>“Compare,”</em> which allows users to compare multiple datasets within the BPD side-by-side. The BPD web interface includes a short walk-through tutorial for new users. </p> -->
