	<h2 class="mat-h2 mb-4">Audit Data Standardization: The Foundation of a Building Performance Policy</h2>

	<p>A critical element of any BPS policy is the collection of standardized building energy audit data. Ideally organizations will use a single, consistent tool like Audit Template. This sort of consistent, single-tool solution represents the highest level of data standardization – Tier 3. Tier 3 maximizes the value, persistence, usability, and transportability of audit data. We recommend this pathway for organizations committed to the most ambitious goals, or to those in the early stages of launching a BPS policy and who don’t have pre-existing commitments to other tools. </p>
	<p>If circumstances prohibit the use of a single tool like Audit Template to collect data, Tier 2 is the preferred alternative. In Tier 2, all tools and systems which touch audit data must be able to export that data in a common format, like BuildingSync. This is a great path for programs that can’t migrate from existing tools but still want the benefits of data standardization. Many of the building energy data tools in the workflow above can read and write BuildingSync files, and there is considerable active development of BuildingSync-compliant applications by public and private organizations.</p>
	<p>Finally, if it is not possible to standardize on a single tool nor even on a common file format, we recommend the use of common data terms as the very minimum level of standardization – Tier 1. The Building Energy Data Exchange Specification (BEDES) dictionary is a collection of over 600 such terms developed with expert feedback from industry experts. Tier 1 standardization ensures a basic degree of compatibility between audit data systems and tools, although we advise organizations to regularly re-evaluate the ability to upgrade to Tier 2 or 3.</p>
