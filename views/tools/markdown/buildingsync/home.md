BuildingSync&reg; is a common schema for energy audit data that can be utilized by different software and databases involved in the energy audit process. It allows data to be more easily aggregated, compared, and exchanged between different databases and software tools. This streamlines the energy audit process, improving the value of the data, minimizing duplication of effort for subsequent audits, and facilitating achievement of greater energy efficiency.


BuildingSync was initially developed to address the lack of an industry-standard colelction format for energy audit data. Standardizing audit data can help energy auditors, software providers, building owners, utilities, and other entities by maximizing the value that can be obtained from each set of data &ndash; value obtained through collaboration, comparison, and reuse. Taking the form of an XML schema, BuildingSync can be required by building owners, benchmarking program administrators, and audit program managers to allow data analysis abd aggregation across multiple buildings in order to evaluate program performance and analyze trends.


BuildingSync can facilitate a consistent history of building data across the life of a building or a group of buildings, and thus enable lower costs and higher energy performance results. It can also allow easier aggregation and analysis of audits conducted by different companies using different software. BuildingSync covers the essential data collected across all ASHRAE Audit Levels as defined in Procedures for Commercial Energy Audits and includes all data necessary for the calculation of an Asset Score.

Using the schema ensures that data collected for a single building over time is consistent and comparable, that data from different buildings can be easily aggregated and compared for large-scale analysis, and that data can be transferred between a variety of software tools. This streamlines the data exchange process and leads to new opportunities for using the resulting data to achieve greater building energy efficiency.

The schema was built using the standard terminology defined in the Building Energy Data Exchange Specification (BEDES) dictionary. Existing data formats and guidance about how to conduct energy audits were incorporated where possible, making it easier to reconcile and map data from existing databases to BuildingSync.


**Providers of building energy assessment software** can integrate the ability to export BuildingSync-compatible files into their software.

**Providers of energy auditing services** can choose to use software that can output BuildingSync-compatible files, making it easier for their customers to use the data to make decisions.

**Cities and municipalities** that are launching mandatory building benchmarking ordinances and/or mandatory energy auditing ordinances can use BuildingSync to more easily utilize the results of audits to spur energy efficiency improvements by having those results in a common format.

**Building owners** can use BuildingSync to standardize data across their buildings so as to more easily undesrtand opportunities for energy efficiency, easily integrate energy audit information into property management tools for later reference, and/or incorporate BuildignSync into their next RFP for a building energy audit by requiring the auditor to provide data in a BuildingSync-compatible format.

**Utilities** can choose to recommend or require software that uses BuildingSync-compatible files for any programs involving energy audits.
